cyberdudebivash's ManageDrone

ManageDrone is a complete drone management and remote control application. It provides a modern GUI to control a drone, plan missions, view telemetry, and manage payload and camera feeds. It's designed for both hobbyists and professionals seeking an extendable solution to remote UAV operations.

Features
Real-time Remote Control: Manual flight (pitch, roll, yaw, throttle)

Automated Takeoff & Landing

Waypoint Navigation: Plan & upload autonomous missions

Return To Home (RTH)

Live Video Feed (Camera)

Telemetry Monitoring: Battery, GPS location, altitude, speed, flight status

Mission Planning Interface

Flight Log & Replay

Emergency Stop / Kill Switch

Payload Management (if applicable)

Drone Status & Alerts

Full Settings (PID tuning, geofence, firmware, config)

Scalable for Single or Multiple Drones (Fleet Management)

Technology
Programming Language: Python 3.x

GUI Framework: PyQt5 (or Tkinter as fallback)

Drone API: Abstracted (connect to your drone via MAVLink, DJI SDK, etc.)

Prerequisites
Python 3.7+

PyQt5 (pip install PyQt5)

Drone SDK/API libraries (for your UAV model: MAVSDK, DJI, Parrot, etc.)

Optionally: OpenCV if using video feeds

Getting Started
1. Clone this repository

bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ManageDrone.git
cd ManageDrone
2. Install dependencies

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
(or, for minimal demo:)

bash
pip install PyQt5
3. Set up your drone communication
Update the DroneController class in managedrone.py to point to your drone’s wireless link and protocol.

4. Launch the application

bash
python managedrone.py
Usage
Connect to your drone via Wi-Fi/radio or simulator.

Use Takeoff / Land to control basic flight.

Use Manual controls (future extension) for real-time piloting.

Plan missions using the Map view and Waypoints tab.

Monitor Telemetry and Alerts in real-time.

Stream video if the drone supports it (requires DJI/ArduPilot integration).

Architecture
managedrone.py: Main GUI and application logic

drone_controller.py: Low-level drone API commands (adapt for your hardware)

/resources: Icons, config files, and assets

Security
Encrypted and authenticated communication recommended for field use.

Never expose control ports to public internet without secure tunnel.

Keep firmware and application up-to-date.

Extensions
Add support for multiple drones/fleet view

Integrate advanced computer vision or object tracking

Extend telemetry dashboard with graphs and analytics

Add cloud data sync and mobile remote features
